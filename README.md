# Blackjack-Console-Game
Want to look like you're coding, but are actually trying your hand at a riveting game of blackjack?  Well now you can with this console game.
Just install python 3.5.1 to get started.  All the instructions are given in the game.  Have fun!

COMING SOON:
-Next commit will have the ability to split

BUGS:
-Aces don't always work properly for the dealer
-I have noted a bug giving a random blackjack to the player, but have only seen it once
